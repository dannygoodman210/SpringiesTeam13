IMPRESSIONS OF THE ASSIGNMENT: 
The assignment was very fun and a logical means of extending what we learned/developed in the Game assignment. 
We worked very hard to devise and implement a solid design based on everything we've learned in class thus far, 
and we are eager to recieve feedback and to understand better design practices going forward.
